# UMLib Library Management System

<b>Online Library Management System</b> is an open source code system that allows us to use it remotely in the localhost. The main objective of this system is to provide an automated library management system that provides features and interface for both modules; student and admin. Besides, it also involves maintaining the database when the admin enters the new books and the record of books has been issued. </br></br>
When we first acquired the system, we noticed that there is some maintenance that can be done to improve user experience and the system itself. When it comes to coming up with the idea for evolution, we take UMLib as our benchmark to actually gain some ideas. After a few trials of proposing ideas to Dr. Hasan to get his approval, we managed to come up with the idea of providing functionality that could aid people with disabilities . The evolutionary idea that we came up with is to provide a toggle button that allows the user to navigate through the websites using text-to-speech API. Text-to-speech API provided an audio guide specially for special disabled users. Basically, when they hover their mouse to a certain text, the text-to-speech API will read the text and output it as an audio, so the user can listen.
